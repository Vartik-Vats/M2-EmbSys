# LM35 Temperature Sensor
## Introduction
-   LM35 is a temperature sensor that can measure temperature in the range of -55°C to 150°C.
-   It is a 3-terminal device that provides an analog voltage proportional to the temperature. The higher the temperature, the higher is the output voltage.
-   The output analog voltage can be converted to digital form using ADC so that a microcontroller can process it.

VCC: Supply Voltage (4V – 30V)
Out: It gives analog output voltage which is proportional to the temperature (in degree Celsius).
GND: Ground
