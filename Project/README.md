## Introduction
Heating method is generally used to regulate the temperature. The system has the option to turn on the heater. The temperature sensor continues to monitor the temperature and transmits the analogue value to the microcontroller. Through serial communication, the microcontroller processes the temperature sensor's analogue input and outputs a temperature value. The control system's activities are carried out entirely on a microcontroller known as the Atmega328. The heat control system's functionality is coded in embedded C, and the work is demonstrated using simulation in SimulIDE software.
